Electromagnetic Field Optimisation Algorithm used to train a Neural Network

About EFO-
Electromagnetic Field Optimization (EFO) is inspired by the behavior of electromagnets with different polarities and takes advantage of a nature-inspired ratio, known as the golden ratio. In EFO, a possible solution is an electromagnetic particle made of electromagnets, and the number of electromagnets is determined by the number of variables of the optimization problem. It is a population based algorithm in which the population is divided into three ﬁelds (positive, negative, and neutral); attraction–repulsion forces among electromagnets of these three ﬁelds lead particles toward global minima. The golden ratio determines the ratio between attraction and repulsion forces to help particles converge quicklyand effectively. 

In this project, EFO algorithm is used to train a neural network with one hidden layer instead of Backpropagation. For more details refer to the research paper uploaded.
