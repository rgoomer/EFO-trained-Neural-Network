# EFO-Trained-ANN
Electromagnetic Field Optimisation Algorithm used to train a Neural Network.
In this project, EFO algorithm is used to train a neural network with one hidden layer instead of Backpropagation. 

# About EFO
Electromagnetic Field Optimization (EFO) is inspired by the behavior of electromagnets with different polarities and takes advantage of a nature-inspired ratio, known as the golden ratio. In EFO, a possible solution is an electromagnetic particle made of electromagnets, and the number of electromagnets is determined by the number of variables of the optimization problem. It is a population based algorithm in which the population is divided into three ﬁelds (positive, negative, and neutral); attraction–repulsion forces among electromagnets of these three ﬁelds lead particles toward global minima. The golden ratio determines the ratio between attraction and repulsion forces to help particles converge quicklyand effectively.
